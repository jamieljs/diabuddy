    <string name="eighty_desc">This is the number of days when 80–89% of your readings have been in your target range! Keep it up!</string>

    <string name="hundred_desc">This is the number of days when 100% of your readings have been in your target range! Perfect!</string>
    <string name="export_desc">This is the number of times that you have downloaded your Diabuddy data! Analysing your past data is extremely useful in identifying certain areas you may have to work on. For example, if you tend to have hypers at a certain time of the day, you could consider modifying your boluses or basal. Do consult your doctor on such modifications (and show them your downloaded data) if you are unsure!</string>
    <string name="notes_desc">This is the number of days when you took notes in every logbook entry! Taking notes will help you remember what you did right or wrong, or provide specific information about activities, stress or illness that could affect your sugars. This can help you better understand what happens to your sugars under different conditions, making it easier to manage them in the future :D</string>
    <string name="nutrition_desc">This is the number of times that you have searched for a food in your Nutrition tab. Doing this gives you an estimate of the amount of carbohydrates in a certain food item, which can help you count the amount of carbs in your meal and make sure you bolus enough!</string>
